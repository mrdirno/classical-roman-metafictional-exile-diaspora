## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a 'lost' satirical poem by Aulus that caused his exile, full of Roman inside jokes and sharp metaphors.
- Compose a letter from Aulus's wife in Rome, revealing her true reasons for staying and her view of his 'indiscretion'.
- Detail a philosophical dialogue between Aulus and Ariston on whether exile clarifies or corrupts a man's character.
- Describe the contents and origin of the mysterious codex Aulus finds, a text that seems to mirror his own fate.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a digital 'Palimpsest Reader' that allows users to layer and toggle between different versions of a text (e.g., Aulus's original poem, the official charge, his later reflections).
- Create an interactive map of Massilia circa 180 AD, tagging locations from the novel (Aulus's room, Gallus's scriptorium, Ariston's tower) with excerpts and historical context.
